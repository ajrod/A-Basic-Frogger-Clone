A-Basic-Frogger-Clone
=====================

This is a Frogger Clone. It was my first real game I ever made (ages ago). It is written in Visual Basic and pretty well documented. 
For those who want to start making games this may help you get started! 

I made this game as an exercise for myself to learn Visual Basic and become familiar with the IDE, 
Microsoft Visual Studio.

Note: The art assets certainly aren't mine and I take no credit for them.

How to run it
-------

You will need Microsoft Visual Studio, if you don't have it you can pick up the the free version just google
"Microsoft Visual Studio Express VB". Open the .sln file in the repository (after cloning the repo), 
then build and run the game.

Alternatively, you can just play the game by running the executable in 
.../Frogger_AlexanderRodrigues/bin/Debug/Frogger_AlexanderRodrigues.exe.

If you want to see the source the majority of the game logic is in 
A-Basic-Frogger-Clone/Frogger_AlexanderRodrigues/Mainform.vb.

Gameplay
------

The controls are pretty simple. Use the arrow keys to move Frogger to the other side. The goal is to get Frogger
into 4 goal slots while avoiding trucks, and rivers.

You can also toggle the background music on or off by pressing "S" or pause the game with "P".

Goodluck!
